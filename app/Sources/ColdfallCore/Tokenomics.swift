// Where a week's tokens actually went, and what to change.
//
// The meter answers "how much". This answers "why", from the same records,
// because a week that ran out is rarely explained by the total. Four things
// explain most of it:
//
//   1. WHAT EVERY TURN CARRIES. Each request re-sends the conversation so
//      far, the system prompt, the tool definitions of every MCP server the
//      desk started, the memory files, and whatever hooks printed. Measured
//      as the smallest input any turn sent all week: nothing was sent for
//      less, so that is what the desk pays to say anything.
//   2. CACHE. A cache READ costs a small fraction of fresh input (a tenth,
//      or less on the newest models); a cache WRITE costs double, since Claude
//      Code writes the one-hour cache. Reused context is nearly free, rebuilt
//      context is not,
//      so the split between them is the difference between a cheap week and
//      an expensive one.
//   3. MODEL. The same work on a smaller model costs a fraction. What the
//      week would have cost on Sonnet is arithmetic, not an opinion.
//   4. THE DESK. Cost per turn varies enormously between desks doing
//      different work, and the outlier is the one worth looking at.
//
// Everything here is read from files the CLIs already write. Nothing is sent
// anywhere, and anything that is an estimate says so where it is shown.
