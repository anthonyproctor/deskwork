// Leaving.
//
// Coldfall never reimplements an agent, so leaving should cost nothing: the
// CLIs, their logins, conversations, hooks and memory files are the vendors'
// and are not touched. What Coldfall has of its own is two folders, plus one
// thing it changed elsewhere — if live Claude limits were turned on, it set
// `statusLine` in that account's settings.json to its recorder script (which
// still runs whatever statusline was there before).
//
// This lists all of it, undoes the statusline, and deletes the folders. It is
// here rather than in the app so the list can be tested against a fake home
// instead of someone's real one.
