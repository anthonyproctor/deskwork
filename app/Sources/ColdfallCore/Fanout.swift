// Fan-out — the mailbox, applied to several slices at once.
//
// The mailbox does one question and one answer. That is the right shape for a
// second opinion and the wrong one for a review: "look at these twelve files"
// becomes a single invocation pointed at a whole tree, which is both expensive
// and imprecise. The first live use of the bridge did exactly that and sent
// the responder grepping through an entire workspace to answer one question.
//
// A fan-out asks the same question of N narrow slices in parallel, then asks
// one more time with every answer as context. That last step is the point: N
// opinions the human has to reconcile is worse than no opinions.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT
//
// Not a graph, not a DAG, not a config format. Every orchestration framework
// starts as "agents hand work to each other" and ends as a worse programming
// language that nobody can debug. The mailbox's whole virtue is that it is a
// FILE — readable, diffable, keepable — so a fan-out is a DIRECTORY of those
// files and nothing more. If you cannot `cat` the state of a run, this is the
// wrong design.
//
// Concretely, a run looks like:
//
//     mail/fanout-2026-09-20-143022-review/
//       00-ask.md          the question, and what it was sliced across
//       01-src-api.md      one thread per slice, same format as any thread
//       02-src-web.md
//       ...
//       merge.md           every answer as context, one reply
//
// WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN A FRAMEWORK
//
// N slices cost N times the tokens, and Coldfall is the only thing in the loop
// that knows what the vendor has left. A fan-out that quietly spends the rest
// of your week is a bug, so this one prices the run first, refuses when the
// budget says no, and says which vendor has room instead.
