import PackageDescription

// Two targets on purpose. ColdfallCore must not import AppKit — that boundary
// is what keeps a future Linux or Windows front end a UI project rather than a
// rewrite. Roughly a third of the code lives below the line and is already
// nothing but file reads and CLI invocations.

        // From a fork, for one line: SwiftTerm 1.20 lists its Metal shader as
        // a processed resource, and Swift 6.4's SwiftPM (macOS 27's Command
        // Line Tools) compiles that with the Metal toolchain, which CLT does not
        // include, so a source build failed with "unable to spawn process
        // metal". The fork is v1.20.0 plus that file moved to the exclude list;
        // the renderer, which Coldfall never turns on, loads the shader source
        // at runtime anyway. Upstream did the same after its 2.0 API break, so
        // this goes away when Coldfall moves to SwiftTerm 2.
